* rsc3 for Racket

This is a port of the [[http://rd.slavepianos.org/?t=rsc3][rsc3]] [[https://supercollider.github.io/][SuperCollider]] client to Racket. rsc3 is written by [[http://rd.slavepianos.org/][Rohan Drape]] and ported to Racket by [[https://khafateh.com/][Mustafa Khafateh]] based on the Thu Jun 27 2013 version. The current version of rd--rsc3 is available at [[https://gitlab.com/rd--/rsc3][gitlab]]

** Install

If you have raco installed you can Install rsc3 with =raco pkg install rsc3=

** Using

Require the module, open SuperCollider or sclang and write some synthetic audioâ€¦
#+BEGIN_SRC racket :lang racket
(require rsc3)
#+END_SRC

The names of  ugens have been adapted to scheme style (e.g. =FSinOsc= to =f-sin-osc= ) but are usually obvious. Specifics can be checked in =rsc3/main.rkt= and there are some useful examples in the =rsc3/examples/= folder (some may need tweaking to work with Racket)

* Documentation

The scheme files in file:doc/help/ correspond closely to the SuperCollider help files included in the standard distribution and can easily be used alongside them (the schelp source files can be found at [[https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/tree/develop/HelpSource][github]]). Examples from the help files, tutorials and other sources are included in the [[file:doc/][doc folder]].
