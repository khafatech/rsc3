;; (ball in g damp friction)

;; Physical model of bouncing object.

;; Models the path of a bouncing object that is reflected by a
;; vibrating surface.

;; in       - modulated surface level
;; g        - gravity
;; damp     - damping on impact
;; friction - proximity from which on attraction to surface starts
