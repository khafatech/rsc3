;; (buf-rd numChannels rate bufnum phase loop interpolation)

;; Plays the content of a buffer.

;; The number of channels must be a fixed integer. The architechture
;; of the SynthDef cannot change after it is compiled. NOTE: if you
;; supply a bufnum of a buffer that has a different numChannels then
;; you have specified to the buf-rd, it will fail silently.

;; The interpolation type is an integer: 1 no interpolation, 2 linear
;; interpolation, 4 cubic interpolation.
