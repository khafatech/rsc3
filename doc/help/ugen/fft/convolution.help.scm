;; (convolution in kernel framesize)

;; Strict convolution of two continuously changing inputs. Also see
;; [convolution2] for a cheaper CPU cost alternative for the case of a
;; fixed kernel which can be changed with a trigger message.

;; in        - processing target
;; kernel    - processing kernel.
;; framesize - size of fft frame, must be a power of two
