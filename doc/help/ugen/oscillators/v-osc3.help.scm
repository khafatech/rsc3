;; Three variable wavetable oscillators.

;; A wavetable lookup oscillator which can be swept smoothly across
;; wavetables. All the wavetables must be allocated to the same
;; size. Fractional values of table will interpolate between two
;; adjacent tables. This unit generator contains three oscillators at
;; different frequencies, mixed together.

;; This oscillator requires a buffer to be filled with a wavetable
;; format signal.  This preprocesses the Signal into a form which can
;; be used efficiently by the oscillator.  The buffer size must be a
;; power of 2.

;; This can be acheived by creating a Buffer object and sending it one
;; of the "b_gen" messages ( sine1, sine2, sine3 ) with the wavetable
;; flag set to true.

;; Note about wavetables: Vosc3 requires the b_gen sine1 wavetable
;; flag to be ON.

;; Allocate and fill tables 0 to 7 with a generated list of harmonic
;; amplitudes.
