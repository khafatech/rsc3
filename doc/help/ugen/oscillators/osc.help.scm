;; (osc rate bufnum freq phase)

;; linear interpolating wavetable lookup oscillator with frequency and
;; phase modulation inputs.

;; This oscillator requires a buffer to be filled with a wavetable
;; format signal.  This preprocesses the Signal into a form which can
;; be used efficiently by the oscillator.  The buffer size must be a
;; power of 2.

;; This can be acheived by creating a Buffer object and sending it one
;; of the "b_gen" messages ( sine1, sine2, sine3 ) with the wavetable
;; flag set to true.

;; Note about wavetables: oscN requires the b_gen sine1 wavetable flag
;; to be OFF.  osc requires the b_gen sine1 wavetable flag to be ON.
