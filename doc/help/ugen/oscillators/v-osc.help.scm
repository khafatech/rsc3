;; (v-osc rate bufpos freq phase)

;; Variable wavetable oscillator.  A wavetable lookup oscillator which
;; can be swept smoothly across wavetables. All the wavetables must be
;; allocated to the same size. Fractional values of table will
;; interpolate between two adjacent tables.

;; This oscillator requires a buffer to be filled with a wavetable
;; format signal.  This preprocesses the Signal into a form which can
;; be used efficiently by the oscillator.  The buffer size must be a
;; power of 2.

;; This can be acheived by creating a Buffer object and sending it one
;; of the "b_gen" messages ( sine1, sine2, sine3 ) with the wavetable
;; flag set to true.

;; This can also be acheived by creating a Signal object and sending
;; it the 'asWavetable' message, saving it to disk, and having the
;; server load it from there.

;; Note about wavetables: Vosc requires the b_gen sine1 wavetable flag
;; to be ON.

;; Allocate and fill tables 0 to 7 [see also Vosc3]
