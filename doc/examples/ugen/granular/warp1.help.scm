;; (warp1 nc buf ptr freqScale windowSize envbuf overlaps windowrandRatio interp)

;; Warp a buffer with a time pointer

;; inspired by Chad Kirby's SuperCollider2 warp1 class, which was
;; inspired by Richard Karpen's sndwarp for CSound. A granular time
;; strecher and pitchshifter.

;; nc - the number of channels in the soundfile used in bufnum.

;; buf - the buffer number of a mono soundfile.

;; ptr - the position in the buffer.  The value should be between 0
;;       and 1, with 0 being the begining of the buffer, and 1 the
;;       end.

;; freqScale - the amount of frequency shift. 1.0 is normal, 0.5 is
;;             one octave down, 2.0 is one octave up. Negative values
;;             play the soundfile backwards.

;; windowSize - the size of each grain window.

;; envbuf - the buffer number containing a singal to use for the grain
;;          envelope. -1 uses a built-in Hanning envelope.

;; overlaps - the number of overlaping windows.

;; windowrandRatio - the amount of randomness to the windowing
;;                   function.  Must be between 0 (no randomness) to
;;                   1.0 (probably to random actually)

;; interp - the interpolation method used for pitchshifting grains. 1
;;          = no interpolation. 2 = linear. 4 = cubic interpolation
;;          (more computationally intensive).
