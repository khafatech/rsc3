;; (tw-choose trig array weights normalize)

;; The output is selected randomly on recieving a trigger from an
;; array of inputs.  The weights of this choice are determined from
;; the weights array.  If normalize is set to 1 the weights are
;; continuously normalized, which means an extra calculation overhead.
;; When using fixed values the normalizeSum method can be used to
;; normalize the values.  TWChoose is a composite of TWindex and
;; select
