;; (sync-saw rate syncFreq sawFreq)

;; A sawtooth wave that is hard synched to a fundamental pitch. This
;; produces an effect similar to moving formants or pulse width
;; modulation. The sawtooth oscillator has its phase reset when the
;; sync oscillator completes a cycle. This is not a band limited
;; waveform, so it may alias.

;; The frequency of the slave synched sawtooth wave should always be
;; greater than the syncFreq.
