;; (lf-pulse rate freq iphase width)

;; A non-band-limited pulse oscillator. outputs a high value of one
;; and a low value of zero.  Note that the iphase argument was not
;; present in SC2.

;; freq - frequency in Hertz
;; iphase - initial phase offset in cycles ( 0..1 )
;; width - pulse width duty cycle from zero to one.
