;; (buf-comb-c buf in delaytime decaytime)

;; Buffer based comb delay line with cubic interpolation

;; All pass delay line with cubic interpolation which uses a buffer
;; for its internal memory. See also buf-comb-n which uses no
;; interpolation, and buf-comb-l which uses linear interpolation. Cubic
;; interpolation is more computationally expensive than linear, but
;; more accurate.  See also comb-c.

;; buf       - buffer number.

;; in        - the input signal.

;; delaytime - delay time in seconds.

;; decaytime - time for the echoes to decay by 60 decibels. If this
;;             time is negative then the feedback coefficient will be
;;             negative, thus emphasizing only odd harmonics at an
;;             octave lower.
