@section{description}

String represents an array of link::Classes/Char##Chars::.

Strings can be written literally using double quotes:

@racketblock[
"my string".class
::
A sequence of string literals will be concatenated together:
]

@racketblock[
x = "hel" "lo";
y = "this is a\n"
    "multiline\n"
    "string";
::

Backslash is the escape character. See link::Reference/Literals#Characters::.

@section{subsection}
  Character encodings

Note that, while Char does not support encodings aside from ASCII‚Äîsuch as
multi-byte encodings like UTF-8 and UTF-16, or the full Latin-1 (ISO 8859-1)
character set‚ÄîChars with negative values are perfectly legal, and may be strung
together in strings that use these encodings.

The SuperCollider IDE uses UTF-8 (a superset of ASCII) to decode and display
strings, which means that the string 
@racketblock["üéπüôÑüéªüòÇüéöÔ∏èüéõÔ∏èüé§üòç":: can be written in
the editor, posted in the post window, and treated for the most part like any
other string.
However, because non-ASCII UTF-8 characters consist of two or more bytes,
and a SuperCollider String's members are one-bit Chars, concepts of size and
indexing may not behave intuitively.
For instance, the "]

@racketblock[size::" of the string above is 38, not 8, and the value
of its first index is ]

@racketblock[-16::, which is not a valid ASCII value at all but
rather the signed 8-bit representation of the first byte of the UTF-8 value of
the piano keyboard emoji (üéπ), ]

@racketblock[0xF09F8EB9::.

  Accessing characters

@section{method}
 @, at
Strings respond to .at in a manner similar to other indexed collections. Each element is a link::Classes/Char::.

@racketblock[

::

]
@section{method}
 ascii
Returns an Array of ASCII values of the Strings's characters.

@racketblock[
"wertvoll".ascii // [ 119, 101, 114, 116, 118, 111, 108, 108 ]
::

Note that if a string contains multi-byte UTF-8 characters, this array will not
be of the same length as the number of visible characters, nor will it
necessarily be an array of valid 7-bit ASCII values.

]

@racketblock[
// "face with tears of joy" is Unicode codepoint U+1F602, which is encoded in UTF-8 as hex value 0xF09F9882
a = "üòÇ";

// although this is one UTF-8 character, it must be stored as 4 Chars because Chars can only hold 1 byte each
a.size // 4 (!)
a.ascii // [ -16, -97, -104, -126 ]

// "wrap(0, 255)" converts these numbers to their unsigned 8-bit values
b = a.ascii.wrap(0, 255) // [ 240, 159, 152, 130 ]

// if we represent these values in hexidecmial, it's the same as the UTF-8 above: 0xF09F9882

@section{method}
 matchRegexp
POSIX regular expression matching. Returns true if the receiver (a regular expression pattern) matches the string passed to it. The strong::start:: is an offset where to start searching in the string (default: 0), strong::end:: where to stop.

  Searching strings

@section{method}

 Unix Support

Where relevant, the current working directory is the same as the location of the SuperCollider app and the shell is the Bourne shell (sh). Note that the cwd, and indeed the shell itself, does not persist:

"pwd".unixCmd;
"cd Help/".unixCmd;
"pwd".unixCmd;

"export FISH=mackerel".unixCmd;

It is however possible to execute complex commands:
]

@racketblock[

Also on os x applescript can be called via osascript:

You should use this method on a path before embedding it in a string executed by link::#-unixCmd:: or link::#-systemCmd::.

@racketblock[
unixCmd("ls " + Platform.userExtensionDir.shellQuote)
::
]
@section{note}
 
This works well with shells such as strong::bash::, other shells might need different quotation/escaping.
Apart from usage in the construction of shell commands, strong::escaping is not needed:: for paths passed to methods like pathMatch(path) or File.open(path).

@section{method}
 absolutePath
@section{method}
 asAbsolutePath
Return this path as an absolute path by prefixing it with link::Classes/File#*getcwd:: if necessary.

@section{method}
 asRelativePath
Return this path as relative to the specified path.
@section{argument}
 relativeTo
The path to make this path relative to.

@section{method}
 withTrailingSlash
Return this string with a trailing slash if that was not already the case.

@section{method}
 withoutTrailingSlash
Return this string without a trailing slash if that was not already the case.

@section{method}
 basename
Return the filename from a Unix path.

@racketblock[
"Imaginary/Directory/fish.rtf".basename;
::

]
@section{method}
 dirname
Return the directory name from a Unix path.

@racketblock[
"Imaginary/Directory/fish.rtf".dirname;
::

]
@section{method}
 splitext
Split off the extension from a filename or path and return both in an link::Classes/Array:: as [path or filename, extension].

@racketblock[
"fish.rtf".splitext;
"Imaginary/Directory/fish.rtf".splitext;

@section{subsection}
 YAML and JSON parsing

@section{method}
 parseYAML
Parse this string as YAML/JSON.
@section{returns}
 
A nested structure of link::Classes/Array::s (for sequences), link::Classes/Dictionary##Dictionaries:: (for maps) and link::Classes/String::s (for scalars).

@section{method}
 parseYAMLFile
Same as 
@racketblock[parseYAML:: but parse a file directly instead of a string. This is faster than reading a file into a string and then parse it.

@section{subsection}
 Document Support

@section{method}
 newTextWindow
Create a new link::Classes/Document:: with this.

@racketblock[
"Here is a new Document".newTextWindow;
::

]
@section{method}
 openDocument
Create a new link::Classes/Document:: from the path corresponding to this. The selection arguments will preselect the indicated range in the new window. Returns this.

@racketblock[
(
String.filenameSymbol.asString.openDocument(10, 20)
)
::

]
@section{method}
 findHelpFile
Returns the path for the helpfile named this, if it exists, else returns nil.

@racketblock[
"Document".findHelpFile;
"foobar".findHelpFile;
::

]
@section{method}
 help
Performs link::#-findHelpFile:: on this, and opens the file it if it exists, otherwise opens the main helpfile.

@racketblock[
"Document".help;
"foobar".help;

 Misc methods

@section{method}
 speak
Deprecated. See link::Classes/Speech:: for the full reason and possible replacements. Sends string to the macOS speech synthesizer.

@racketblock[
"hi i'm talking with the default voice now, i guess".speak;
::

]
@section{method}
 inspectorClass
Returns class link::Classes/StringInspector::.


@section{subsection}
 Drawing Support

The following methods must be called within an Window-drawFunc or a SCUserView-drawFunc function, and will only be visible once the window or the view is refreshed. Each call to Window-refresh SCUserView-refresh will 'overwrite' all previous drawing by executing the currently defined function.

See also: link::Classes/Window::, link::Classes/UserView::, link::Classes/Color::, and link::Classes/Pen::.

@section{note}
 
for cross-platform GUIs, use 
@racketblock[Pen.stringAtPoint, Pen.stringInRect, Pen.stringCenteredIn, Pen.stringLeftJustIn, Pen.stringRightJustIn:: instead.
::

]
@section{method}
 draw
Draws the String at the current 0@0 link::Classes/Point::. If not transformations of the graphics state have taken place this will be the upper left corner of the window. See also link::Classes/Pen::.

w.view.background_(Color.white);
w.drawFunc = {
	"abababababa\n\n\n".scramble.draw
